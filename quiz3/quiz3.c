/* Instructions:
 *
 *1. Following on from what you have learnt in class today, write a program to return the grade associated with a range of marks.
 2. The range of marks and the associated grades are as follows:
 a. 91-100 = A
 b. 81-90 = B
 c. 71-80 = C
 d. less than or equal to 70 is a fail grade and should be given an F
 e. greater than 100 is invalid and your code should print "Invalid"
 
 3. Use the skeleton code provided below to create a new function "printGrade" with its appropriate
 data type for input of marks. For example, printGrade(<data type> marks).
 
 4. Use print statements in your function to display the grade. For example, if the input marks is 77, the output should read:
	"Your grade is : C"
 5. Please adhere to standard C syntax conventions and use comments to explain your code. Failure to do so will result in a penalty.
